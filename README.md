# life_expectancy_and_gdp
Welcome to my first serious enough data analysis. In here I expose some conclusions obntained with, as you'll see, not quite complex code.
Hopefully, if you are enroled in the codecademy's datascience path (like me), you'll have some insights or support. 
Constructive critiques are hugely welcomed, as well as collaboration proposals of any kind.
Thanks for reading me.
